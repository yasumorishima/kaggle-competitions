# Kaggle Competitions

Kaggle Notebooks Expert. 7 Bronze Notebook Medals + active competition participation.

**Note:** Notebook Medals are earned through community votes on shared notebooks - NOT competition ranking medals.

## ☁️ Cloud Workflow (GitHub Actions + Kaggle API)

All competition work runs **fully in the cloud** — no local GPU or large disk required.

```
Edit notebook (any device) → git push → GitHub Actions → kaggle kernels push → Submit via browser
```

### How It Works

1. Edit `.ipynb` locally or on any device
2. `git push` to this repository
3. Trigger via GitHub Actions: `gh workflow run kaggle-push.yml -f notebook_dir=<dir>`
4. GitHub Actions runs [`kaggle kernels push`](.github/workflows/kaggle-push.yml) to upload the notebook
5. Submit via Kaggle browser UI ("Submit to Competition")

### Key Findings

- **`enable_internet: false`** is required for code competition submissions — Internet ON prevents the notebook from being eligible
- **`competition_sources`** mounts data at `/kaggle/input/competitions/<slug>/` (not `/kaggle/input/<slug>/`)
- **API submission (`CreateCodeSubmission`) returns 403** — `kernelSessions.get` permission is not available in public API tokens (as of Feb 2026). Manual browser submit is the only option.

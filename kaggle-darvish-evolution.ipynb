    "# Yu Darvish: 5-Year Pitching Evolution (2021-2025) | Statcast Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "## About This Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yu Darvish** is one of the most fascinating pitchers in modern baseball. A veteran Japanese pitcher with 17+ MLB seasons, Darvish has been with the San Diego Padres from 2021 through 2025. Known for his extraordinarily deep pitch arsenal (regularly throwing 7-10 different pitch types), he presents a unique case study in pitcher aging and adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The central question**: How does a veteran pitcher adapt his approach as velocity naturally declines with age? Rather than simply throwing harder, elite pitchers often reinvent themselves -- shifting from power to craft, developing new pitches, and changing how they attack hitters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data source**: All data comes from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) / MLB Statcast, accessed via the [`pybaseball`](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) Python library. Statcast tracks every pitch in MLB with radar and camera systems, providing granular data on velocity, spin rate, movement, and outcomes.\n",

    "## Conclusion & Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Over 5 seasons with the Padres (2021-2025), Yu Darvish's pitching evolution tells a compelling story of adaptation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. From Power to Craft\n",
    "In 2021, Darvish relied heavily on his slider (SL, 31%) and sweeper (ST, 23%) -- two power breaking balls that together made up over half his pitches. By 2025, these two pitches dropped to just 24% combined. In their place, he significantly increased usage of the curveball (CU: 4.6% to 15.4%), cutter (FC: 2.5% to 12.2%), and sinker (SI: 8.3% to 20.0%). This represents a fundamental shift from overpowering hitters with velocity and sharp break to outmaneuvering them with a diversified, less predictable arsenal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Velocity Decline, But Maintained Effectiveness\n",
    "Darvish's four-seam fastball velocity dropped from 94.5 mph (2021) to 93.9 mph (2025) -- a modest but meaningful decline. Spin rates also trended downward across most pitches. Rather than fighting this natural aging process, Darvish adapted by leaning into pitches that don't depend on raw velocity: the curveball, cutter, and sinker are all effective at lower speeds when located well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Whiff Weapon Evolution: Splitter to Curveball\n",
    "Perhaps the most telling change: Darvish's best swing-and-miss pitch shifted from the splitter (FS) in 2021-2022 to the curveball (CU) in 2023-2025. The curveball posted a remarkable 44.0% whiff rate in 2023 and remained his top whiff pitch at 33.8% in 2025. By 2025, the curveball had also become his #1 two-strike pitch (21.8% usage with two strikes), displacing the fastball and sweeper that previously dominated putaway situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture\n",
    "Darvish's evolution is a textbook example of how elite pitchers age gracefully. Instead of clinging to diminishing velocity, he continuously expanded and rebalanced his pitch mix, effectively becoming a different (and arguably more sophisticated) pitcher in his late 30s than he was in his early 30s.\n",
